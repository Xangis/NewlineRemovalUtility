# NewlineRemovalUtility

This is a simple Windowsapp for removing newlines from a text file. It was 
originally released at http://zetacentauri.com and was downloaded more than 
1400 times before being open-sourced.

A prebuilt Windows installer is in the installer directory:

This app requires the .NET framework 3.5 or newer.

## Development Status

I consider this app to be complete and it is no longer under active development.
I am willing to accept pull requests if you have improvements to contribute.
